##REALLY PLANNED:

 - Switch to Kafka/Naoko, drop Celery as it's bad for compiled code
 - Flag for minimal upgrade without deps updates for safety

##I DON'T WANT TO DO IT (contributions welcome):

 - Stream announce (e.g. stream in 30 mins or something like that) + stream announce role
 - Select menu roles
 - Some of slash commands are still missing (vs command, etc...)
 - Documentation
 - Rework config files for simpler/wider usage
 - Youtube streams support
