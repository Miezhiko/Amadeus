##REALLY PLANNED:

 - Single interface for bert models processing on mozart
 - Store long-term conversation with everyone in DB, use Summarize model for context generation
   (Run Summarization generation periodically, possibly on deep nights)
   (Use generated context for Bert models later)

##I DON'T WANT TO DO IT:

 - Stream announce (e.g. steam in 30 mins or something like that) + stream announce role
 - Select menu roles
 - UnixSockets alternative for Windows
 - CodeBERT
 - Some of slash commands are still missing (vs command, etc...)
 - I need part of speech tagging POSModel but for russian langauge, that could be used for Kathoey
 - Finetune GTP2 model
 - Documentation
 - Rework config files for simpler/wider usage
 - Youtube streams support
